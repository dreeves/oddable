[BU = Bayesian updating of opinion (in the presence of a decision maker)]
[D = Probability density function]
Often quoted review paper which is a clear forerunner of the Bayesian approach to aggregation of opinions. The so-called natural conjugate approach is suggested in which each expert's opinion is deemed as ``sample evidence'' which is incorporated into a decision maker's prior by successive applications of Bayes' theorem. Numerical examples are included.}

[BU = Bayesian updating of opinion (in the presence of a decision maker)]
[D = Probability density function]
[P = Discrete probabilities]
Formulates a theory of expert use which is entirely consistent with the Bayesian philosophy. Here, each expert probability distribution is treated as a random variable whose value is to be revealed to the decision maker. To obtain the consensus distribution, this decision maker must then proceed to introspect a likelihood function representing his/her assessment of the different experts' knowledge and combine their opinions with his/her own using Bayes' rule. Some examples illustrate the mechanics of the theory.}

[BU = Bayesian updating of opinion (in the presence of a decision maker)]
[D = Probability density function]
Sequel to the 1974 paper in which a pooling formula of a multiplicative nature is derived in the case of the location-scale family. The idea-of calibration is introduced and a method for subjectively calibrating an expert is also presented. Some fictitious examples illustrate the results. Morris' definition of ``joint calibration'' has been criticized by Schervish (1983) and Clemen (1986).}
